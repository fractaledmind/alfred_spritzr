    The padding property is very similar to the margin property; however, it falls inside of an element’s border, should an element have a border. The padding property is used to provide spacing directly within an element. Locutionary content is close to the semantic meaning of a syntactic group, regardless of intention or circumstance. Illocutionary Act requires for it success that the Audience recognize that you are trying to say something in some way (as a Statement, as a Warning, as Irony). The Perlocutionary Act requires that your intention be actualized for it to succeed. Such success is termed “Uptake”. The failures can be either an “Infelicity” or a “Misfire” The former is a partial failure, the latter is a total failure. What in the world is all this nonsense. I can't keep it all straight. It just keeps flowin' out like a river. Like a long river that has no source and no ocean. Just a perpetual river
